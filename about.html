        I am a Senior at James Madison University graduating in May 2020. I have loved technology all my life and have been working with computers since I can remember. Even though I had a passion for it I didn't know the specific route to take. When I first came to college I majored in Computer Science. Since I had HTML,CSS, and a little database knowledge coming into school I thought that would be the perfect route. The major really opened my eyes to the vast world of coding and the different languages. It also helped me realize that this is not the major I want to continue persuing. The code was just too mundane for me so I then switched to Computer Information Systems. I thought it was weird that a computer class was in the business school, but I still chose to switch. The major felt almost the same to me so it still did not feel like I found my place yet. Even though I switched from those majors it helped me get an perspective from all the different points of view when it comes to designing in the real world, from backend to front end, to the business tactics it takes to make your business thrive. I started desining three years ago when I starting making album artwork for my music and at the time I considered it a hobby. Then after I meet some Interactive Design majors and they told me the things they did I finially realized what I want to do. Not only do I love creating but I love the visual gratification that I get with it. I tend to make simple designs because I belive that a good design should be simple yet impactful.I love to see past projects and the progress I have made over the years, it is great motivation for me to keep working on my craft. Once I started desining I knew I wouldn't look back.

        I like to design with simplicity in mind. I like to keep everything in my life from what I eat to how my apps are organized on my phones simple. I believe that as long as your design send the message to people keep it simple makes it that much easier for a person to understand. I've ignored design much of life even though it is part of my life everyday, but now that I know the change I can make with it I work hard to try to push my skills. I still make album artwork with Photoshop mostly and some Illustrator but I started practicing with HTML and CSS by making my own website with the Bootstrap framework.

        I get most of my influence from my music. Since I started in 2017, I've applied a lot to my design methods. My music is unique in the way that I do everything myself. From making instrumentals, vocals, mixing, and mastering I realized how important the small things are for your art to have that uniqueness. Music is much easier than UX Design for me because I have not been working on visual desings like websites; I am still understanding the foundations of design. I am also learning how to make a simple website like I have made to catch a readers eye by adding depth and motion to my sites.
